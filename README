# HPC Matrix Multiplication Benchmark

This project benchmarks different parallel programming models (OpenMP, MPI, CUDA planned) using dense matrix multiplication as the baseline workload.  
The goal is to demonstrate performance scaling across programming models and hardware backends.

## Serial Implementation (Baseline)

- Language: C++17  
- Algorithm: Naive triple loop matrix multiplication  
- Input: Random integers in `[0, 99]` (fixed seed for reproducibility)  
- Output: Matrix `C = A Ã— B`, plus runtime in milliseconds  

### Example Run
```bash
./bin/mm_serial 512
Matrix size: 512x512
Serial runtime: 121 ms
Check: C[0][0]=..., C[N-1][N-1]=...
